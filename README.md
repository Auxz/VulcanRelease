  # Vulcan
  Vulcan was originally going to be a large scale project to sell, however I quickly realized that violating Discord's TOS was not worth it, so I scrapped the project. After demonstrating Vulcan to a few people, a  few people were interested in it, hence why I'm uploading it here. Vulcan doesn't have much work put into it (developed in 2 days).
