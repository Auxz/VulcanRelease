  ## Vulcan
  > Vulcan was originally going to be a large scale project to sell, however I quickly realized that violating Discord's TOS was not worth it, so I scrapped the project. After demonstrating Vulcan to a few people, a  few people were interested in it, hence why I'm uploading it here. Vulcan doesn't have much work put into it (developed in 2 days), Vulcan has quite a lot of mistakes and it's far from my best work as a programmer,  I stopped mid development so there is prone to be errors and such. Feel free to make a pull request to help iron out issues, as I don't have much interest in fixing Vulcan, however it's likely I'll commit to this repository to fix the following issues
  ### To-do
  - [ ] Complete logging with more events (currently only contains one event)
  - [x] Add a constructive help command
  - [ ] Fully document code using comments
  - [ ] Miscellanous fixes
